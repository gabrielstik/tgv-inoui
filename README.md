# TGV-INOUI
A website which can be a proposal for a TGV Inouï marketing campaign using CSS3 transforms, interractions, animations and transitions. 

## Constraints
I had to use
* CSS3 Transforms
* CSS3 3D Transforms
* CSS3 Interractions
* CSS3 Transitions
* CSS3 Animations

## Features
* Admire the train moving the camera along with it
* Play animation that turns around the train and shows its 3D shapes

## Features I would love to add
* A way to drive the train
* Lot of decorative elements
* More rounded shapes

## Run
You can directly run the operational version of the website which is in _dist_ directory.

### Task runner
This project was made with the help of Gulp & my own [static-template](https://github.com/gabrielstik/static-template).

### Source files
All source files are in _src_ directory.

#### Styles
Styles are splitted into _.scss_ files according to what they refer to.$
* *_variables.scss* contains all CSS variables used for this project
* _main.scss_ contains global classes & big sections styles
* _libraries_ contains a custom CSS reset file
